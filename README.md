# LFP_RGS14

The main branch contains the core scripts
These scripts largely rely on scripts from Adritools and Corticohippocampal. 
The delta_analysis_milan.m and spindle_analysis_milan2.m scripts further rely on the FMA toolbox by Michael Zugaro.
swr_analysis_milan.m is the script used for ripple detection
delta_analysis_milan.m is the script used for delta detection
spindle_analysis_milan2.m is the script used for spindle detection
power_analysis_RGS14.m calculates the powerspectrum and the theta-ratio normalized to 30Hz
power_analysis_RGS14_delta.m calculates the powerspectrum and the delta-ratio normalized to 30Hz

In the secondary branch are the scripts that are close copies of the core scripts and scripts secondary to the scripts in main

The tertiary branch contains scripts used for visualisation or that are copies of previous scripts with minimal difference. These are largely inconsequential.
